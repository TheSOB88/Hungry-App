This is a C project I wrote that parses text files and counts occurences of words using an AVL tree. I wrote it for a job application, but I think it shows off my programming skills nicely. The code is pretty well documented, and I completed it fairly fast.

I don't really have a lot of coding projects - working on code every day kind of drains me out. But that's the main thing I want to change about myself - I want to learn how to work longer and be more disciplined. I need to be way more productive than I currently am if I ever want to start a company, so that's definitely something I'm looking to change, and I'm going to work really hard to get there.

This project doesn't have a Makefile, but I used "gcc avl.h avl.c concordance.c" to produce the executable. 

To use the program, just call it with the name of a text file and it will count the occurences of all of the words present in the text. There are 3 example texts included for easy testing.

Ex: a.out beowulf.txt

Thanks for reading!
